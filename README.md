# Pip-Boy Third-Party Program Repository

A tool to add apps and upload files to your Pip-Boy. Contains third-party apps and Bangle.js app ports.
This version is a bit of a spaghetti-code mess and is frankensteined together to achieve a result, not to be efficient.

## Writing apps

If you put a JS file in the USER folder, Pip-Boy will
show it in a list of apps in the `INV` screen.

The following variables are available to you:

```JS
LED_RED             //  Red element of RGB LED
LED_GREEN           //  Green element of RGB LED
LED_BLUE            //  Blue element of RGB LED
LED_TUNING          //  Radio tuning indicator LED
BTN_PLAY            //  "Play" button - *** WARNING: No JS code will run if this button is held down during boot! ***
BTN_TUNEUP          //  "Up" button
BTN_TUNEDOWN        //  "Down" button
BTN_TORCH           //  "Flashlight" button
KNOB2_A             //  Thumbwheel encoder A - PA9 for v0.3, PA10 for v0.5
KNOB2_B             //  Thumbwheel encoder B
KNOB1_BTN           //  Left knob "select" button
KNOB1_A             //  Left knob encoder A
KNOB1_B             //  Left knob encoder B
BTN_POWER           //  "Power" button

Pip.on("knob1", (dir)=> {
  dir = -1 / 1 / 0;
});
Pip.on("knob2", (dir)=> {
  dir = -1 / 1;
});
Pip.on("torch", ()=> {
  // torch button
});
```

* `g` is a graphics instance that writes direct to the screen
* `bC` is a graphics instance that writes to a 2 bit offscreen buffer, and calling
`bC.flip()` will flip that buffer to the screen with a scanline effect.

You should create a function `Pip.removeSubmenu()` that removes your app from memory (eg clears all intervals, removes all event listeners added).
